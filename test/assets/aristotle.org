Blah blah, some sort of text, yadda yadda.

When things have only a name in common and the definition of being which corresponds to the name is different, they are called /homonymous/. Thus, for example, both a man and a picture are animals. These have only a name in common and the definition of being which corresponds to the name is different; for if one is to say what being an animal is for each of them, one will give two distinct definitions.

When things have the name in common and the definition of being which corresponds to the name is the same, they are called /synonymous/. Thus, for example, both a man and an ox are animals. Each of these is called, by a common name, an animal, and the definition of being is also the same; for if one is to give the definition of each—what being an animal is for each of them—one will give the same definition.[fn:1]

There are these difficulties, then, [in the way of the assumption that that which is not can be in motion], and it may be further objected that, whereas everything which is in motion is in place, that which is not is not in place; for then it would be somewhere.[fn:2]
